* **articulate.qml** version 3.1 introduces a new feature which inserts (changed) on-time/off-time annoations under all notes in a region differing from the normal (0, 1000). Select a region, invoke the plugin, and the "Show in score" button will appear along with the others. Press it to insert the numbers.  You can do a whole score at once, if you wish.  There is an undo button in the dialog, which appears when the numbers are up, otherwise they can be undone all at once the usual way (Ctrl-Z/Cmd-Z), or just left there for illustration. Each can be selected and deleted like any other staff text.  Once you press "Show in score", you can only cancel without removing the numbers, or press "undo", which also exits, but undoes the numbers first.
