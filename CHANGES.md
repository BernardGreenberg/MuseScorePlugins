* **rednote.qml** version 3.1 moves the plugin from the "Notes" sub-menu of "Plugins" to the latter's top-level.  There seems to be a bug in Qt/MS such that plugins at other than the top level, activated by shortcuts, sometimes fail to be activated from those shortcuts, and the problem is mysteriously "solved" by switching away from the MuseScore app and switching back and issuing the shortcut again.  Albeit the problem's root remains mysterious, this change improves the plugin's reliability.

* **appoggiatura.qml** version 3.1 introduces the ability to specify nonzero separation (or overlap) between the end of the appoggiatura (or *appoggiature*) and the start of the main note. This had previously been constrained to be zero, which is how it is created by MuseScore.  The first text field has been renamed from *perMille* to *Main note start ‰*.  The second text field, *Separation ‰*, is the positive separation between the end of the *appoggiatura(e)* and the start of the main note.  In almost all cases, leave it as zero. \
\
But with experience and skill, and varying criteria for different instruments and sound fonts, you can use negative values (try -20, -40, -50, whatever pleases you in each case) to create overlap, simulating enhanced legato between the *appoggiature* and the main note, when desired.  The effect is variably audible, subtle, and very pleasing when sufficiently finessed for voices and string instruments.

* **articulate.qml 3.2** fixes a bug in 3.1 that would create an unreadable score if you stored the annotations into it, say, if you were perhaps writing a phrasing tutorial .... 

* **articulate.qml** version 3.1 introduces a new feature which inserts on-time/off-time annotations as staff text under all notes in a selection for which either differs from the normal 0 and 1000. Select a region, invoke the plugin, and the "Show in score" button will appear along with the others. Press it to insert the numbers into the score.  You can do a whole score at once, if you wish.  There is an undo button in the dialog, which appears when the numbers are up, which will undo them all, or, alternatively, you can just leave them there for illustration, or undo them the usual way (Ctrl-Z/Command-Z). Each annotation can be selected and deleted like any other staff text.  Once you press "Show in score", you can only cancel (relabelled "Leave them") without removing the numbers, or press "Undo show", which also exits, but undoes the numbers first.
