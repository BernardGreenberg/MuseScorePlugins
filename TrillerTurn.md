**Turns with the triller plugin**

The triller plugin can be used to create carefully-timed “turns” and “inverted turns”, although some care is required. Here is an example
(the circled note) and the triller plugin parameters that produce the effect on the second staff.  The “Final” of 750 cuts out three sixteenths 
from a quarter note, leaving one-sixteenth to be ornamented. Four *Schläge* (beats) covers the turn, and the final note of 750 extends the last beat,
as always with the Triller plugin.

The graphics and tie were added in the following way.  First, the quarter-note was placed.  Then the “turn” ornament was added from the “Ornaments”
palette, and silenced by turning off “Play”.  Then the plugin was used to create this ornamentation, and, finally, the tie applied to the G in
the next measure.

The small sharp under the turn graphic can be added as a “Symbol”, or even a Staff Text; its autoplace attribute must be checked off.
