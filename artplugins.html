<p>Working with Dale Larson, Matt McClintock, and Dmitrios95, we have effected changes
to MuseScore that I have wanted for a long time, to wit, the ability to customize note
and appoggiatura attack and release parameters from plugins.</p>

<p>The (long-intended) result of this is a trio of plugins attached here, which
allow customization of note attack and release, fraction of a note consumed by one
or more appoggiature, and customized Baroque trills, on an individual note (or selection)
basis, via straightforward, convenient GUI interface, removing the need to ever deal
with the arcane and clumsy Piano Roll Editor or “hacked portati” or other articulations.
Hopefully, with some exposure and design iteration, these will become “standard plugins”,
although I would like to see this functionality in the core.</p>

<p>They are provided here in a zip file, which, if you want them, you must unload
into the Plugins directory, and follow the normal directions to install plugins.
Right now, these will not work with the Released MuseScore; you need a so-called
“development build” for your OS at least as new as 14:00 UTC (10:00 EST) 30 July 2019.</p>

<p>The plugins and their musical effects are:</p>

<dl>
   <dt>articulation.qml</dt>
   <dd>most useful if plugin shortcut key defined; I use ctrl-alt T). Allows
     the setting of on-time and off-time (which start as 0 and 1000) to any value,
     allowing literally a thousand degrees of detachment or smoothness, providing
     complete and easy effectuation of phrasing. Some of my favorite non-1000
     off-times are 500 (staccato), 850, 900, 920, 960. On-time adjustment is mainly
     useful for simulating polyphonic violin bowing. Click on a note, type the shortcut,
     edit values and click Apply or Cancel (or type ESC or Enter). If a region (blue box)
     is selected, you can impose on off-time on the whole passage (or staff or score as you select).
     All effects are undoable. It can also be invoked simply to learn the on/off times of a note in
     a score (just dismiss with ESC).</dd>
   <dt>appoggiatura.qml</dt>
   <dd>(again, shortcut if you use it often enough, as in the piece below; I use Ctrl-Alt A).
     How much (what percent) of a note an appoggiatura should consume is a contentious
     subject, even between historical and current performers and other experts, and is
     highly context-dependent. While MuseScore currently imposes rigid global answers,
     this plugin allows you to set the percentage (again, as a 0-1000 “permillage”) for
     individual occurrences to taste, including multiple and chordal appoggiature. Again,
     the plugin can be used to simply inspect the current fraction of appoggiatura-decorated
     notes.</dd>

   <dt>triller.qml</dt>
   <dd>This facilitates imposition of a Baroque trill, always an even number of notes,
     any number of notes, on any note, discarding possible previous ornamentation.
     It does not “chase accidentals”, which is both a deficit and an advantage compared
     to built-in trills — you have to tell it whether upper and (if needed) lower neighbors
     are a half- or whole-tone away. You can add pre-strokes (Vorschlag) from above or below,
     as is common in Baroque music, and a Mordent at the end. “Vorschlag” creates four notes,
     mordent 2, and anything left in the number of notes you tell it go into trilling.
     You can play with 6, 8, 10, 12, whatever you want, effects not possible without plugin
     help. The German terms are used (oben = above, unten = below) because most appropriate
     trill tables originated in Baroque now-Germany, and do so. It does not now insert
     ornament graphics (TBD).</dd>
